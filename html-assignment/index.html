        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I enjoy creating things with my hands, such as knitting bags, knitting dolls, making figures, and crafting miniatures.
            For that reason, I initially wanted to pursue <em>Baking and Pastry Arts Management</em> at Algonquin College.
             However, all of sudden, <abbr title="Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada">IRCC</abbr>'s policy changed,
             and if I major in baking, I won't be eligible for a work permit after graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
            After consulting with a school advisor and exploring various option, I decided to apply for the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>.
            While it's different from handcrafting, I find it fascinating to create something creative with just my fingertips.
            Although everything feels new and unfamiliar, I'm ready to learn and grow in this field.
